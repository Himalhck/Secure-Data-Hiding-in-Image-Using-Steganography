# Secure-Data-Hiding-in-Image-Using-Steganography
Project Overview

This project implements steganography, a technique for hiding secret messages inside images. Using Python and OpenCV, the script encodes a message within an image's pixel values and retrieves it with a passcode. This ensures covert communication while keeping the image visually unchanged.
